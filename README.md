# Think Dotfiles

Here are the latest dotfiles for my personal setup. I'll update them over time as I continue to make changes, but just know these may be missing some things that I have recently done to it. This is my first ever setup using Wayland, and I'm actually really enjoying it so far. You are free to play with the dotfiles for your own system, but know that this is intended for my system and that it may not work correctly on yours. I am happy to answer any questions, though, and try to help you out.
